# Art Synthysis Ocarina
For this I made an Ocarina similar to the one in the game Zelda Ocarina of Time. To play notes either press the holes on the Ocarina or press the keys 'a', 'w', 's', 'z', 'd', 'f', or 'g' corresponding to the placement of the holes. Each hole represents a note, and you can play A, B, C, high D, low D, E, and F
